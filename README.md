MSX Rom cartridge for roms up to 64KB

This is yet another PCB design of a ROM cartridg that can hold roms up to 64 KB. Different configuration options regarargind the Z80 page (CS1/CS2/CS12) for 8, 16 and 32 KB ROMS are included using jumpers (/RD option is also available).

This design also includes the possibility of switching between LOW/HIGH 32KB pages when using 27C512 (64KB) ROMs.
The PCB is compatible with W27C256/W27C512 EEPROMs.
Compatible with 64KB ROMS generated by SGC Image Creator

# Set-up

1) Solder 100nF (C2) and 4.7uF (C1) capacitors. 
2) Solder a 10K resistor at R1
2) Close Jumpers OE and SLTSL
3) Close ONLY ONE jumper (RD, CS1, CS2 or CS12) depending on the ROM configuration. Typically, CS1 and CS2 are used for 8/16KB ROMS, CS12 for 32KB ROMs. RD is usually connected for 64KB ROMs.
4) Set A15 jumper for 32 or 64 KB ROM (27C256 or 27C512, respectively)
5) JP1 jumper: left for 64KB ROM / right for 32K ROM(s)
*** 64 KB ROM with two 32 KB programs (0000 - 80000 / 8000 - FFFF)
1) Set the corresponding jumper to 32 KB
2)  change the ROM page (A15 to Vcc / A15 to ground - HI/LO jumper).

* Remember swapping low and high memory in each 32KB block
